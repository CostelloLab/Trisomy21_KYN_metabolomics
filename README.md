### Included in this Repo

To ensure reproducibility, all data for this project can be found in the Data/ directory and the R code to generate all figures can be found in the R/ directory. Descriptions for each data file and R script are below.

#### Data

* **Human_plasma_metabolomics.csv** - Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 participant characteristics and raw intensity values (relative abundance) from semi-targeted LC-MS plasma metabolomics
* **Human_plasma_metabolomics.csv** - Same data as Human_plasma_metabolomics.csv formatted as an R [eset](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/3.7/bioc/vignettes/Biobase/inst/doc/ExpressionSetIntroduction.pdf) object
* **Human_plasma_MSD.csv** - Mesoscale discovery assay data from a subset of Cohort 2 samples
* **Human_fibroblast_flux.csv** - Targeted LC-MS flux metabolomics data for timecourse experiment on human fibroblasts
* **Mouse_plasma_metabolomics.csv** - Targeted LC-MS metabolomics data on plasma from D21 and T21 (Dp10, Dp16 and Dp17) mice

#### Code

To reproduce the figures from this project, first make sure you have all dependencies installed the run each of the numbered R scripts in order. These scripts will create a folder called Results/ and each script will subsequently output plots and/or tables to an appropriate subfolder named for each figure (e.g. Result/Figure_1/). General descriptions of each script are below, and additional information can be found in the headers of the scripts themselves.

Dependencies:

* plyr (>= 1.8.4), tidyr (>= 0.8.0), dplyr (>= 0.7.4)
* affy (>= 1.54.0), Biobase (>= 2.36.2), preprocessCore (>= 1.38.1)
* impute (>= 1.50.1), limma (>= 3.32.10), glmnet (>= 2.0-13)
* RColorBrewer (>= 1.1-2), beeswarm (>= 0.2.3)
* ROCR (>= 1.0-7), pROC (>= 1.10.0), classInt (>= 0.2-3)

R Scripts:

* **00-model_fitting.R** - pre-processes human metabolomics data and fits linear model with batch, age and sex covariates. Saves plots for Figure 1 figure supplement 2A-D in the Results/Figure_1/ folder.
* **01-differential_abundance.R** - performs differential abundance analysis on human plasma samples. Saves plots for Figure 1A and Figure 1 figure supplement 1B-C in the Results/Figure_1/ folder.
* **02-pathway_enrichment.R** - performs hypergeometric testing for pathway enrichment on human plasma samples. Saves plot for Figure 1C and supplemental table of results in the Results/Figure_1/ folder.
* **03-boxplots_t21_vs_d21** - plots boxplots of differentially abundant metabolites, tryptophan pathway metabolites and metabolite ratios. Saves plots for Figure 1B, Figure 3, and Figure 3 supplement 1 in the Results/Figure_1 and Results/Figure_3 folders.
* **04-lasso_biomarker.R** - performs univariate and multivariate biomarker analysis to learn a metabolic signature of trisomy 21. Saves plots for Figure 2A-C in the Results/Figure_2 folder.
* **05-fibroblast_timecourse.R** - pre-processes and plots timecourse data from the flux metabolomics experiment on human fibroblasts. Saves plots for Figure 4A-C and Figure 4 figure supplement 1A-D in the Results/Figure_4 folder.
* **06-cytokine_correlations.R** - correlates kynurenine and quinolinic acid in human plasma with Mesoscale Discovery assay data. Saves plots for Figure 6 in the Results/Figure_6 folder.
* **07-mouse_kynurenine.R** - plots kynurenine levels in mouse plasma with and without treatment with poly(I:C). Saves plots for Figure 5 in the Results/Figure_5 folder.
